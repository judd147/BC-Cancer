## Team Name
ClientFirst Solutions

## Date
October 21

## What Went Well
- We delivered our presentation within 8 minutes.
- Our wireframe caught clients' eyes and we clearly answered clients' question on tags.
- No technical issues during the presentation.
- We had a clear and concise presentation.
- We had a good team dynamic and worked well together.
- We were able to answer all the questions that the clients had.

## What would we do better next time
- Look at the clients' faces more often instead of looking at the slides or notes.
- Speak louder and more clearly.
- Nod more often to show that we are listening to the clients' feedback
- Nod when the team members are speaking to show that we agree with what they are saying, to show team unity.
- Make sure to have a backup plan in case the technology fails.
