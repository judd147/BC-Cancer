## What would we do better next time
- Look at the clients' faces more often instead of looking at the slides or notes.
- Speak louder and more clearly.
- Nod more often to show that we are listening to the clients' feedback
- Nod when the team members are speaking to show that we agree with what they are saying, to show team unity.
- Make sure to have a backup plan in case the technology fails.
