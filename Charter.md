## Team Values and Norms

We commit to upholding the following values and norms to foster a positive and productive team environment:

1. **Respect:** [Describe how team members will show respect]
   The team will show respect by listening to each patiently, valuing each other’s opinions, and maintaining a professional tone in all communications.

   Team members will openly share information, ask for help when needed, and acknowledge each other’s contributions to foster a sense of reliability and accountability.
3. **Punctuality:** [Set expectations for meeting attendance]
   Meetings will start on time, with everyone expected to attend unless prior notice is given. Team members will arrive prepared, having completed any assigned tasks or pre-reading. Each member will take responsibility for delivering their best work on time, while focusing on both technical excellence and client satisfaction.

4. **Commitment to Quality:** [Outline the standards for quality]
   The team will set high standards for the work produced, ensuring that the code is thoroughly reviewed, well-documented, and adheres to the client's needs. Feedback will be actively encouraged to continuously improve the output.

## Decision-Making Process

Decisions within the team will be made using the following process:

1. **Consensus:** [Describe how consensus will be achieved]
   For most decisions, the team will aim for consensus by encouraging open discussion where all members can share their perspectives. Consensus will be achieved when all team members agree on a decision even if it’s not their preferred choice. This approach ensures everyone’s voice is heard.

2. **Majority Vote:** [Outline when majority vote will be used]
   When consensus cannot be reached after thorough discussion, the team will resolve the matter through a majority vote. A simple majority will suffice to carry a decision unless otherwise specified.

3. **Designated Decision-Maker:** [Identify roles with decision-making authority]
   In situations where expert judgment is required, specific roles within the team will have decision-making authority. For example, technical decisions may be deferred to the lead developer, and client-related decisions may fall under the project manager’s responsibility. These roles will be clearly defined to ensure clarity and efficiency.

## Communication Plan

Effective communication is crucial for our success. Our communication plan includes:

1. **Tools:** [List tools, e.g., Slack, email, meetings]
   We will utilize Microsoft Teams for daily communication, in-person meetings for detailed discussions, Google Docs for collaborative documentation, and Notion for project management and task tracking.
2. **Frequency:** [Set frequency for updates and meetings]
   The team will meet two to three times a week to provide updates, review progress, and address any challenges. Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed.
3. **Reporting:** [Outline how progress will be reported]
   Meet with TAs and instructors, upload relative information to GitHub.
   All relevant information, including code updates, documentation, and progress reports, will be uploaded to GitHub for team-wide visibility and version control. Progress will be reported by meeting with TAs and instructors to share updates and gather feedback.

## Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

Conflicts will be addressed promptly using the following mechanisms:

1. **Open Discussion:** [Encourage open discussion of issues]
   Team members are encouraged to address conflicts directly and respectfully through open discussion. The goal is to allow everyone involved to voice their concerns and work collaboratively to find an acceptable solution.
2. **Mediation:** [Describe the mediation process]
   If an open discussion does not resolve the conflict, a neutral team member or a designated mediator will step in to facilitate further conversation. The mediator will help ensure that both parties are heard and guide the discussion towards a fair resolution. This process aims to maintain objectivity and focus on finding common ground.
3. **Escalation:** [Outline steps for escalating unresolved conflicts]
   If mediation does not lead to a resolution, the issue will be escalated to higher authorities, such as external mentors (TAs or instructors). At this stage, the conflict will be assessed, and a decision will be made to ensure that the team can move forward effectively while maintaining a positive work environment.

## Performance Expectations

We have set the following performance expectations to maintain high standards:

1. **Metrics:** [List performance metrics]
   Code quality: Measured by the number of bugs or issues identified during code review.
   Timeliness: Tasks and milestones should be completed within the agreed-upon deadlines.
   Collaboration: Active participation in discussions, meetings, and team activities.
   Client satisfaction: Meeting the client’s requirements and addressing feedback efficiently.
2. **Goals:** [Set specific performance goals]
   Complete all assigned tasks by the deadline with minimal need for rework.
   Ensure all code is properly documented, reviewed, and tested before submission.
   Fulfill the client’s needs and tackle real-world problems effectively.
   Foster a collaborative environment where all team members actively contribute to discussions and problem-solving.

3. **Feedback:** [Describe how feedback will be provided and used]
   Feedback will be provided regularly through peer code reviews and weekly team meetings. Constructive feedback will be used to identify areas for improvement and recognize strengths. Additionally, feedback from clients and TAs will be reviewed to refine the team’s approach and continuously enhance performance.

## Meeting Schedules and Agendas

Regular meetings will be scheduled as follows:

1. **Frequency:** [e.g., Weekly, bi-weekly]
   The team will meet two to three times a week to provide updates, review progress, and address any challenges. Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed.

2. **Agenda:** [Describe how agendas will be prepared and shared]
   Agendas will be prepared by the team lead or designated meeting organizer before each meeting. Team members will be encouraged to submit discussion points or concerns ahead of time. The agenda will be shared via Microsoft Teams or Notion at least 24 hours before the meeting to ensure that everyone is prepared.

3. **Minutes:** [Outline how meeting minutes will be recorded and distributed]
   Meeting minutes will be recorded by a rotating team member. The minutes will include key decisions, action items, and any deadlines. After each meeting, the minutes will be shared with the team via Google Docs or Notion to ensure transparency and provide a reference for team members who were unable to attend.

## Ensuring Adherence to the Charter

To ensure we adhere to this charter, we will:

1. **Regular Reviews:** The team will review the charter at key milestones and quarterly to ensure it remains relevant and is being upheld.
2. **Accountability:** Team members will address any adherence issues respectfully through direct conversation. Support will be offered to those facing challenges, such as illness, to ensure tasks are completed.
3. **Flexibility:** If any team member fails to adhere to this charter, team members should talk about it first with respect. Team members should help each other, by helping those who cannot finish their assigned part due to illness, etc.
4. **Leadership:** The team lead or project manager will oversee adherence, but all members share responsibility for upholding the charter.
